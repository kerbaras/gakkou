Gakkou is an open source project created for an assigment in a subject at University of La Plata. It's not intended to endure in time

If you'd like to contribute feel free to submit any issue or review issues/pull requests.

In order for me to accept incoming pull request i'll wait for the assigment to be approved.

Thank you for reading!
